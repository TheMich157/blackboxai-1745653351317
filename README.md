# Roblox Game Portal

## Project Overview
The Roblox Game Portal is a web-based application designed to help players manage their Roblox game experience. It allows users to track their game statistics, view live server statuses, and manage their account settings. This application features a user-friendly interface built using Tailwind CSS, ensuring an attractive and responsive design.

## Installation
To set up the Roblox Game Portal locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd roblox-game-portal
   ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.** 
   There is no additional backend required to run this application as it primarily utilizes front-end technologies. However, for full functionality (like login and registration), it is recommended to set up the corresponding API on a local or remote server.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the navigation to register or log in to your account.
